\chapter{Conclusions}



\paragraph{} Highly oscillating functions can be really challenging to compute. Even more so in an efficient manner.
As has been seen in the previous chapter, in the simple, constant oscillating frequency case, the Filon quadrature method of numerical integration brings a significant improvement over the conventional (trapezoidal) method of numerical integration.
